These are the basic codes written for basic image classification problem. The folder includes different codes: a basic logistic regression code, a basic neural net code(written with help of numpy), same code written in Tensorflow 1, and then a code involving Convulation neural nets. All the codes were inspired from Andrew Ng's initial deep learning courses available on coursera.Data set was downloaded from Kaggle.(rgbTohd5.py contains the code to convert rgb images to an hd5 file helping to make a data set)
