I have written this simple code of text generation using RNN after going through many codes on the internet.This code is an example many to one model and is a Character Based Model. I tried to run this code on many input text files. For sonnets, it apparently generates good results. It also works well for Dinosaur name. For Jass Manak songs, it almost generated the same song but i geuss that was due to repetitive lines in data set, and for Ammy_virk_songs, it generated output which made some sense but the whole passage was not coherent enough. (Last two are punjabi singers and punjabi songs are just written in english). Short stories as a text file doesnt produce good output, may be a word model will help to rectify this. But it still produces some gibberish text which makes sense in some lines but not as a whole.
